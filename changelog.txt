INDEV RELEASE v0.4.1.1 [Cull the Dupes] (December 21st, 2025)
Additions:
+ Added command that kills all duplicate Town NPCs, as well as a warning message upon joining a world with duplicate Town NPCs
	-> I wished it didn't have to come to this, but unfortunately I have still been unable to debug why exactly Town NPCs have been duplicating this last update.
	-> As such, by adding this command, I can alleviate the actual issue in the meantime while I continue to work on figuring out why this is happening in the first place.
	-> Thank you for your patience on this!
Changes:
* Changed the internal license of the code from GPLv3 to AGPLv3
