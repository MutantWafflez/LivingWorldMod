INDEV RELEASE v0.4.0.2 [Revitalization Hotfix #2] (February 13th, 2025)
Fixes:
* Fixed Town NPCs de-spawning on servers due to the NPC trying to draw on the server (servers can't draw!)
	-> This fix also fixes the "ghost" Town NPCs in multiplayer sessions, since the crash occurs on the server but doesn't break on the client, causing a de-sync.
