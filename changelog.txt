INDEV RELEASE v0.4.0.0 [The Actual Revitalization Pt. 1] (February 11th, 2025)
Additions:
+ Revamped Town NPC Happiness into the Town NPC Mood System; a much more dynamic version of the vanilla happiness system
+ Town NPCs can now become tired and go to sleep, with variable sleep schedule preferences
+ Town NPCs now have built-in pathfinding, and will utilize it to navigate their surroundings
+ Town NPCs will now talk amongst themselves with actual sentences instead of their usual icons
+ Town NPCs can now blink & talk while walking, instead of exclusively while they are standing still
+ A new type of party called a "Night Party", that takes places the following night of every OTHER boss defeated
+ Added a new "Pause" button in the Harpy Shrine UI that prevents new villagers from spawning
Changes:
* Harpy Egg and Harpy Villager Shrine Items now stack to 9999
* Updated some older UIs with text on the mouse to use backgrounds behind said text
Fixes:
* Fixed conversion error in the code from v0.3.2.0 that broke the village shrine zone
	-> This fixes the issue of Harpies endlessly spawning, or not at all
* Fixed the chat message of a villager re-spawning not properly showing the new villager's name
